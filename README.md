# Headless DNS widget starter for Vue

Build a DNS setup flow in your own Vue interface using the [Approximated headless DNS API](https://approximated.app/docs/#dns-widget-headless).

This is a **headless** integration. Vue renders the interface; Approximated supplies provider-specific instructions and DNS verification results as JSON. It does not embed the ready-made widget or an iframe.

The starter includes provider instructions, copyable record values, optional automatic setup links, verification results, retries, and a local server endpoint that creates short-lived widget tokens.

## Availability

This starter targets the upcoming headless DNS API release. The hosted `headless.v1.js` client and instructions endpoints must be deployed before live DNS setup works. You can install the starter, run its interface, build it, and run its tests in the meantime. The tests use stubs and do not need an API key or live DNS.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 22.12 or newer, npm, and an Approximated cluster API key for live requests. CI uses the Node version in `.node-version`.

Use GitHub's **Use this template** button, or clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Approximated-Inc/headless-dns-widget-vue-starter.git
cd headless-dns-widget-vue-starter
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

- Set `APX_API_KEY` to your cluster API key. It is read only by the Node server. Never give it a `VITE_` prefix or put it in frontend code.
- Set `VITE_CNAME_TARGET` to the hostname your application asks customers to point to. `domains.example.com` is an example, not a working target.

Start the app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173** exactly as printed by the server. The local server accepts only this loopback address; `localhost` and other hostnames are rejected. Enter a domain and click **Get setup instructions**. You do not need to change DNS to inspect instructions. Verification succeeds only when the expected records are published.

The browser loads `https://cloud.approximated.app/dnswidget/headless.v1.js`. Your Node server uses the API key to obtain a short-lived token, and the browser uses that token to request instructions and verify records.

## Adapt the starter

- `src/`: the Vue interface and entry point.
- `shared/session.js`: records to request, session state, token expiry, cancellation, and protection against stale responses.
- `shared/browser.js`: the public CNAME target and headless client adapter.
- `shared/styles.css`: the interface styles, including the Approximated carnation palette.
- `token-server.mjs`: `POST /api/dns-widget-token`, which returns only the token and disables response caching.
- `server.mjs`: the local Vite and token server.
- `test/`: token endpoint and session lifecycle regression tests.

Edit the `records` array in `shared/session.js` to request the A, CNAME, or TXT records your app needs. The default requests one CNAME for the domain the customer enters. In this API, `@` means the **full supplied domain**, including any subdomain. For `shop.customer.com`, Cloudflare's display name is `shop`.

Render each returned field step's `label` and `value`: provider display values can differ from the request. An empty field value means leave that field blank. TTL values may be labels such as `Auto` or `1 Hour`.

The interface renders text, links, and fields without inserting raw HTML. Manual steps remain available when automatic setup is unavailable. Verification shows the record address, expected value, actual values, and match state. Customers can retry partial or failed checks.

## Integrate with your application

Move the Vue components and shared modules into your frontend, include the versioned headless client, and implement the token route in your backend. In a server-rendered framework, initialize the browser client inside a client-side component.

Before minting a token, authenticate the customer, check their permission to configure the domain, and apply your normal request limits and CSRF protection. Keep the API key in your server's secret store and preserve `Cache-Control: no-store` on the token response.

The included server is a local development example and refuses to run with `NODE_ENV=production`. Its Host/Origin checks do not replace your app's authentication. Do not deploy it as your production backend.

DNS verification confirms which records DNS currently returns. It does not prove tenant ownership, create a virtual host, or confirm routing and HTTPS. Complete those checks in your backend before marking a domain ready.

## Build and test

```sh
npm test
npm run build
```

The build writes frontend assets to `dist/`. A deployed integration also needs the authenticated server token endpoint described above. CI runs the tests and build on every pull request and push to `main`.
